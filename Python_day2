Question 1 : What is the difference between == And is operator ?
Solution:

== (Equality operator)           |   is (Identity operator)

Compares the equality of objects  | Checks if different variables are pointing to same object in memory.else



Question 2 : XOR operators 

XOR is a bitwise operator that is also known as Exclusive OR.
It is a logical operator which outputs 1 when either of the operands is 1 , but both are not 1 and both are not 0.

The symbol for XOR in Python is '^'

eg: num3 = num1 ^ num2


0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
0 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 0 = 0


Question 3 : What is the life scope of a variable and what type of life scope  ?
Solution : 
Life scope of a variable is the location where we can find the variable and also access it if required.


Its types :
1. Local variable.
2. Global variable.


Local Variable :
Variables that are initialized within a function, and are unique to that function. 
It cannot be accessed outside of this function.

Example :

def func():
 
    # local variable
    s = "I love python"
    print(s)
 
# Driver code
func()

OUTPUT :
I love python

## If 's' is accessed outside the function func(), then it will give an error.

Global Variable :
Variables that are declared outside of any function , and are not specified to any function. 
It can be used in any part of the program.

Example :

# This function uses global variable s
def func():
	print(s)


# Global scope
s = "I love python"
func()

OUTPUT :
I love python
