# List comprehension :  
#A Python list comprehension consists of brackets containing the expression, 
# which is executed for each element along with the for loop to iterate over each element in the Python list.

# Syntax: newList = [ expression(element) for element in oldList if condition ] 

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
squared = [x ** 2 for x in numbers] 
print(squared)

#output
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


matrix = [[j for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)] 
    
print(matrix)

#[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]
